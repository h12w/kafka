kpax: a modular & idiomatic Kafka client in Go
==============================================

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/h12.io/kpax?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/h12.io/kpax)

Install
-------

```
go get -u h12.io/kpax.v1
```

### Compatibility

h12.io/kpax.v1 is compatible with Kafka Server 0.8.2.

Design
------

The client is built on top of Kafka Wire Protocol (i.e. low-level API). The protocol related types & marshal/unmarshal functions are automatically generated by [wipro](https://github.com/h12w/wipro) from [the HTML spec](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/A+Guide+To+The+Kafka+Protocol)).

`(-)` means to be done.

### Sub packages

* **model** is an abstraction model for request, response, broker and cluster
* **broker** is a lazy, asynchronous and recoverable round tripper that talks to a single Kafka broker
* **cluster** is a metadata manager that talks to a Kafka cluster
* **proto** contains both low level API and a "middle" level facade
* **producer**: fault tolerant high-level producer (batching and partitioning strategy)
* **consumer**: fault tolerant high-level consumer (consumer group and offset commit)
* **log**: replaceable global logger
* **cmd**
    - **kpax**: command line tool to help with Kafka programming

### Error Handling

* broker
  + fail fast: timeout returns error immediately
  + release resources carefully
  + reconnect when requested next time
* client
  + metadata reload lazily (only when a leader/coordinator cannot be found in cache)
  + leader/coordinator should be deleted on error
* producer
  + fail over to another partition
  + failed partition will be retried again after a period of time
  + partition expand (-)
* consumer
  + just loop & wait on error
  + partition expand (-)
* graceful shutdown (-)

### Efficiency

* efficiency
  + batching
    - consumer response
    - consumer request (-)
    - producer (-)
  + decompression
    - snappy
    - gzip (-)
  + compression
    - snappy (-)
    - gzip (-)
